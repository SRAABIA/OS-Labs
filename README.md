## Operating Systems Labs || NUCES- FAST || THIRD SEMESTER LABS
<p align="center">
  In this repository I have uploaded the programming assignments of OPERATING SYSTEMS' COURSE we studied in 4th semester.
  These labs are performed in Ubuntu Linux using a Oracle VMware, whereas, Dual-booting your computer is also an option I tried.
  The tasks assigned for certain labs are uploaded in this file. Some of the labs include the installation and using the software services so there was no specific task assigned in that lab.
